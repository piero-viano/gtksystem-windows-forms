# GTKSystem.Windows.Forms
### Introduction

Native Visual Studio development, no learning curve, compile once, run cross-platform.
A cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) C# desktop application framework based on GTK components.
Using this framework, projects can be developed in Visual Studio with the native C# WinForms designer, using the same properties, methods, and events as standard WinForms. Development is done entirely with familiar C# techniques — no additional learning required.

Compile once and run across platforms.
It makes cross-platform WinForms application development easy and enables existing C# WinForms applications to be upgraded to cross-platform applications with minimal effort.
